# sprintBotBLEControl

Code to run on Arduino Nano BLE 33 Sense and connect to the Pipebots app via Bluetooth.  This allows remote manual control.

__NOTE:__ This repo only contains the Arduino code.  The Pipebots Android application that was developed to control the Sprintbot robot was held in a personal repo that can no longer be accessed.

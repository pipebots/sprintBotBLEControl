# Sprint 2 Robot Documentation

- Version 0.0.1
	- My first attempt at documenting the mechanical, electrical and software aspects of Sprintbot, from a Theme 3 perspective.


## Nomenclature
The robot developed in Sprint 2 of the Pipebots project may be refered to as _SprintBot_ or colloquially _BigBallBot_ 
>Note: Some members call it _Sprintbot-2_ which maybe confusing as this was the first robot developed in a sprint, but was undertaken in the second sprint event of the project.

## UML diagrams

You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```
